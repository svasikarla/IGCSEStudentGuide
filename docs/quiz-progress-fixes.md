# Quiz Progress and Dashboard Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve issues with quiz progress storage and dashboard functionality in the IGCSE Student Guide application.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Database Columns**:
   - `completed` column missing from `user_quiz_attempts` table
   - `study_date` column missing from `user_study_sessions` table
   - `cards_reviewed` column missing from `user_flashcard_progress` table

2. **Missing Foreign Key Relationships**:
   - Missing relationship between `user_flashcard_progress` and `topics` tables

3. **RPC Function Errors**:
   - `get_user_study_streak` function referenced non-existent `study_date` column
   - `get_flashcards_reviewed_this_week` function referenced non-existent `cards_reviewed` column
   - `calculate_topic_progress` function referenced non-existent `completed` column

4. **Frontend Code Issues**:
   - Incorrect Supabase filter syntax in `getUserQuizStats` function
   - Missing `completed: true` field in quiz attempt updates
   - Missing `p_quiz_id` parameter in topic progress updates

## Fixes Implemented

### Database Schema Fixes

1. **Added Missing Columns**:
   ```sql
   -- Added to user_quiz_attempts
   ALTER TABLE public.user_quiz_attempts 
   ADD COLUMN completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
   
   -- Added to user_study_sessions
   ALTER TABLE public.user_study_sessions 
   ADD COLUMN study_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE;
   
   -- Added to user_flashcard_progress
   ALTER TABLE public.user_flashcard_progress 
   ADD COLUMN cards_reviewed INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
   ```

2. **Added Missing Foreign Key Relationship**:
   ```sql
   -- Added to user_flashcard_progress
   ALTER TABLE public.user_flashcard_progress 
   ADD COLUMN topic_id UUID REFERENCES public.topics(id);
   ```

3. **Backfilled Existing Records**:
   ```sql
   -- Backfill completed column based on completed_at
   UPDATE public.user_quiz_attempts
   SET completed = TRUE
   WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;
   
   -- Backfill study_date column based on created_at
   UPDATE public.user_study_sessions
   SET study_date = created_at::DATE
   WHERE study_date IS NULL;
   
   -- Backfill cards_reviewed column based on total_reviews
   UPDATE public.user_flashcard_progress
   SET cards_reviewed = total_reviews
   WHERE cards_reviewed = 0;
   
   -- Backfill topic_id column based on flashcard's topic_id
   UPDATE public.user_flashcard_progress ufp
   SET topic_id = f.topic_id
   FROM public.flashcards f
   WHERE ufp.flashcard_id = f.id;
   ```

### RPC Function Fixes

1. **Updated `get_user_study_streak`**:
   - Fixed to use the newly added `study_date` column

2. **Updated `get_flashcards_reviewed_this_week`**:
   - Modified to use `total_reviews` instead of the non-existent `cards_reviewed` column

### Frontend Code Fixes

1. **Fixed `getUserQuizStats` in `useQuizAttempts.ts`**:
   - Removed the `.eq('completed', true)` filter since we've added the column but might not have backfilled all records
   - Kept the `.not('completed_at', 'is', null)` filter to ensure only completed quizzes are counted

2. **Enhanced Dashboard Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed logging for all dashboard data fetching operations
   - Improved error messages to help diagnose issues

## Verification

After implementing these fixes, the dashboard should now correctly display:
- Quiz statistics (total quizzes taken, quizzes taken this week, average score)
- Study streak data
- Flashcards reviewed this week
- Recent activity (quizzes and flashcard reviews)

The user progress should now be properly stored in the Supabase database, and the dashboard should display accurate statistics.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Database Triggers**:
   - Consider implementing database triggers to automatically update related tables when quiz attempts are completed
   - This would reduce the need for explicit function calls in the frontend code

2. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Implement more robust error monitoring to catch schema mismatches early
   - Consider using a schema validation library to ensure frontend expectations match the database schema

3. **Testing**:
   - Create end-to-end tests that verify the entire quiz attempt and progress tracking flow
   - This would help catch issues like missing columns or relationships earlier in development
